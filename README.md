### Code style guide

- Pay attention to the linter!
- Don't use semicolons
- Two spaces
- Trailing commas where possible
- `const` or `let` over `var`
- Use `require` and `module.exports` in `.js` files
- Use `import` and `export` in `.jsx` files, unless `require` makes for cleaner code
- Put import statements at top
- Put the default export at bottom
- Consider splitting up any file larger than 50 lines
- Define container components and presentational components in separate files
- Use the ["ducks" pattern](https://github.com/erikras/ducks-modular-redux) for redux
- Define react components as pure functions (instead of classes) whenever possible
